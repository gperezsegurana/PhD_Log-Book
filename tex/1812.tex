\experiment{Meeting with Pete}
For now, interest in MaxIV is limited to the BC1 and BC2 sections, so in MAD8dl use only latices of those sections to avoid issues with RFCAVITIES.\\
When studying $R_{ij}$, $T_{ijk}$... ensure cumulative matrix starts to be calculated in the relevant region.\\
When playing with MALIGN elements in Elegant, place them right before the section to be studied, to isolate the effects of the section on the beam.\\
